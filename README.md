Arch Project Test for the Role of Flutter Developer.

## Documentation

Summary:

- This project includes a demonstration of simple navigation from a named page and popped.
- Image.asset to demonstrate the loading of an image stored in the project.
- Simple Buttons to interact with that will execute given functions
- Interaction with REST APIs which I chose to use GetRocket (I hard coded the example Falcon9 Rocket), and Missions to demonstrate the use of a list of data.
- I have implemented Bloc the load different states based on the event fired and the state emitted.
- I have tried to keep a clean architecture using data, domain, ui for this simplistic project.

What would I improve on:

- Given more time I would improve the UI and implement dark / light theme with a switch, I have previously implemented this via hydrated Cubit.
- I would improve the bloc logic for better error handling, its very simple at the moment.
- Responses, I would handle responses better, likely by http codes or custom responses/exceptions.
- Better UI in general.
- Finally, I would write some Mock Tests for my apis, and potentially tests for the Bloc.
